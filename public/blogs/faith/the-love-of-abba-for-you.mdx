# Abba's Love For You

<br></br>
Hi there, I'm sure you must have encountered the famous verse of Scripture, John
3:16 which says:
<br></br>
_(Joh 3:16 KJV)  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life._
<br></br>
It's a weighty scripture. **For God so loved you.** It's a thing to love someone
that already cares for you, but to give your own son in exchange for those who
did not love you, who disdain you, that is a different kind of love. No wonder
the Apostle John said in his first letter:
<br></br>
_(1Jn 3:1 KJV)  Behold, **what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,**
that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because
it knew him not._
<br></br>
Oh, truly behold, what manner of love it is! Dying for a good man, seems
reasonable, say maybe the man Nelson Mandela. If he's still alive, and he needed
surgery to extend his life to continue his impactful work, many may line up to
give themselves for the furtherance of him. But what of someone shameful,
someone evil, who actively opposes you, would you die for such? No, right?
**"But God commends His love for us..."**
<br></br>
_(Rom 5:7 KJV)  For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for
a good man some would even dare to die._
_(Rom 5:8 KJV)  **But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were
yet sinners, Christ died for us.**_
<br></br>
For God so loved the world, for God so loved you! Yes, you! He loved you
not just in words, but in deed and truth. Let me leave you with 2 Scripture:
<br></br>
_(2Co 5:19 ISV)  for through the Messiah, God was reconciling the world to
himself by not counting their sins against them. He has committed his message of
reconciliation to us._ 
_(2Co 5:20 ISV)  Therefore, we are the Messiah's
representatives, **as though God were pleading through us.** We plead on the
Messiah's behalf: **"Be reconciled to God!"**_
<br></br>
_(Rom 8:32 KJV)  He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,
how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?_
<br></br>
Please be reconciled to God. He does not count your sins against you. Believe
in the Messiah and Live!
