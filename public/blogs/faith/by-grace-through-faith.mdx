# By grace through faith. 
<br></br>

I often ponder on life, and requirements, and laws, and principles, the necessity of them all. The life we know, both the one we love and dislike, is built on them. They're foundational. They're also the highways upon which experience and effect, action and reaction, is built.
<br></br>

In the midst of all that chaos, I think there's an effect so sublime, grace. It seems antithesis to the current order, an effect entirely independent of you and your works. Here are some Scriptures:
<br></br>

Rom 4:4 (KJV) Now to him that **worketh** is the **reward not reckoned** of **grace**, but of **debt**.
Rom 4:5 (KJV) But to him that **worketh not**, but **believeth on him** that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
<br></br>

and,
<br></br>

Rom 11:6 (KJV) And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
<br></br>

So then, by grace, through faith. I was thinking also today of the limits of grace. Is there limit to grace? I think so. It's the limit of who's paying. I said earlier, I think grace is an effect produced of works, just not your works. Or at least, it's beauty is better expressed in a world built on work. If the gracious has no limit, then the grace supplied is limitless. So the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ then is limitless.
<br></br>

Rom 8:32 (KJV) He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
<br></br>

<div style={{display: "block"}}>a life of effects enjoyed,</div>
<div style={{display: "block"}}>but of works undone.</div>
<br></br>

Mat 11:28 (KJV) Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
