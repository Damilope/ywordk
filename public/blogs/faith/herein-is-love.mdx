# Herein is Love
<br></br>

_1Jn 4:10 (KJV) Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins._
<br></br>

Look at the Scripture above in contrast to:
<br></br>

_Mrk 12:28 (KJV) And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?
Mrk 12:29 (KJV) And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:
Mrk 12:30 (KJV) **And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.**_
<br></br>

Oh, herein is Love, not that we loved God, as we should, but that He so loved us, He gave the Pride of His Strength (**Gen 49:3**), His first-born and only begotten Son as atonement for our sins!
<br></br>

_Jhn 3:16 (KJV) **For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.**
Jhn 3:17 (KJV) For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
Jhn 3:18 (KJV) He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God._
<br></br>

The expectation, and rightly so, is that we love God, just we build and nurture things so that they serve and minister to us, not the other way round. We don't write programs expecting to love it, to serve it, but the opposite. We don't build houses, or instruments and technologies, so as to pour out the rest of our lives in service to it, so as to sacrifice tremendous possessions for it, but for these things to serve and fulfill our pleasures. This is the right purpose. But God so loved the world, that He even gave His only begotten son...
<br></br>

_Rom 5:6 (KJV) For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
Rom 5:7 (KJV) **For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.**
Rom 5:8 (KJV) **But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.**_
<br></br>

Christ died for us, and this makes no sense! Would you die for a house that leaks, will you die for a sheep while it is yet astray, will you die for a broken pen? No! For a righteous man, we'd even think twice before laying our lives for his furtherance, but Christ died for us while we were yet with sin, yet ungodly. I ask you then, what manner of love is this?
<br></br>

_1Jn 3:1 (KJV) Behold, **what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God**: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not._
