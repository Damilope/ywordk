# I haven't written in a while
<br></br>

I enjoy writing, and reading, and I haven't written in a while. Well, not entirely so, I've written stuff, poems, just didn't post them here. I'll do, hopefully, with the grace of God. I'm a firm believer in God and His grace made available through Christ Jesus my Lord. If that reads cringe, sorry. 
<br></br>

So why haven't I written? I've been working on several things, and I find there's many more I'd like to work on, but I only have 2 hands and 24 hours in a day. I worked on a card game for a dear friend [kder.ywordk.com](https://kder.ywordk.com) and made some updates to [fimidara.com](https://fimidara.com). I've also been busy with work. Maybe I've been a bit lazy too.
<br></br>

So I'd like to write more, and I pray I do. I'll also like to build a few things. I'm thinking 
- a sentiments analysis tool, cause it's cool
- a URL tool that'd redirect to specified URLs, so I don't have dead links in my writings and docs
- a publishing house, still figuring that out
- a blogging site, cause currently my blogs are saved in git and I'll like to improve that.
<br></br>

What'd I like to write on? I'm thinking
- daily scriptures, and maybe some little teaching attached
- philosophies, poems, and my thoughts, I really enjoy Philosophy and thinking
- what I'm doing, cause why not, also for motivation
- tech-related stuff, like programming and "other tech"
- maybe some journalism [insert emoji]
<br></br>

That's it for this one. I pray you have a blessed year ahead! Amen in Jesus' name.
