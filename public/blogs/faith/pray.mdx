# Praying
<br/>

There are many things without our control<br/>
as just as many within it. <br/>
So we pray. <br/><br/>

What do you do when you need a change<br/>
but a change is not manifesting?<br/>
When all you can do and muster<br/>
amount to a pittance to a debt so great<br/>
your faith may balk.<br/>
So we pray.<br/><br/>

What do you do or think or feel <br/>
when all is going well, too well <br/>
or YC is taking applications and <br/>
you really want to receive an invitation<br/>
to build something of your dreams?<br/>
So we pray.<br/>
