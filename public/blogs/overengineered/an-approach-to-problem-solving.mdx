# An approach to problem-solving
<br></br>

I've been considering an approach to problem solving and code writing, and it's, solve in parts until you solve in full. Let me explain. 
<br></br>

I'm currently working on a feature for [code-migration-helpers](https://github.com/softkave/code-migration-helpers) and I'm stuck. I think I understand how it should work, but representing it in code seems challenging because there are several moving parts. Basically, I want to add a tool for adding/modifying index files in folders, and propagating added/modified index files to parent folders. Seems simple, but when you consider questions like, 
- what if the file or symbol is already imported?
- what if it's imported but not exported?
- should we use wildcard *  exports, and how should we handle existing wildcard exports?
The list goes on...
<br></br>

A way to approach this complexity in code is to solve partially, like divide-and-conquer. To solve this problem, I need 3 things:
- what symbols to export,
- what symbols have been exported, and
- exporting new symbols.
<br></br>

Having separated the concerns, I have 3 placeholder functions:
<br></br>

```typescript
async function decideSymbolsToExport(filepath: string, opts: Opts): Promise<string[]> {}
async function filterExistingExportedSymbols(symbols: string[], opts: Opts): Promise<string[]> {}
async function exportSymbols(symbols: string[], filepath: string, opts: Opts): Promise<string[]> {}
```
<br></br>

Now, what it'll eventually be may be a bit more complex than this, but I can pick each part and solve it as if the rest is in place.
<br></br>

I'm pretty sure there's most probably a name for this technique, but let me know what you think, and possible improvements.
