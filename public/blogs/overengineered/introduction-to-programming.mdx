# Introduction to Programming
<br></br>

I think there are 4 major building blocks to programming, there may be more. They are:

1. Variables
2. Operators
3. Control Structures
    1. Conditional Statements
    2. Loops
4. Functions

## Variables

Variables are used to store data. They are like containers that hold data. The data can be of different types, like numbers, strings, etc.
<br></br>

Here is an example of a variable in JavaScript:
<br></br>

```js
var x = 10;
```
<br></br>

## Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables. There are different types of operators, like arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, etc.
<br></br>

Here is an example of an arithmetic operator in JavaScript:
<br></br>

```js
var x = 10;
var y = 20;
var z = x + y;
```
<br></br>

## Control Structures

Control structures are used to control the flow of the program. There are different types of control structures, like conditional statements, loops, etc.
<br></br>

Here is an example of a conditional statement in JavaScript:
<br></br>

```js
var x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
  console.log("x is greater than 5");
}
```
<br></br>

### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to execute code based on certain conditions. There are different types of conditional statements, like if statements, switch statements, etc.
<br></br>

Here is an example of an if statement in JavaScript:
<br></br>

```js
var x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
  console.log("x is greater than 5");
} else {
  console.log("x is less than or equal to 5");
}
```
<br></br>

### Loops

Loops are used to execute code repeatedly. There are different types of loops, like for loops, while loops, etc.
<br></br>

Here is an example of a for loop in JavaScript:
<br></br>

```js
let sum = 0;
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  sum += i;
}
```
<br></br>

### Functions

Functions are used to group code into reusable blocks. They are like mini-programs that can be called from other parts of the program.
<br></br>

Here is an example of a function in JavaScript:
<br></br>

```js
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

function addFirstFiveNumbers() {
  let sum = 0;
  for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    sum = add(sum, i);
  }

  return sum;
}
```
<br></br>

### Conclusion

These building blocks are the foundation of programming. Once you understand them, you can start building more complex programs. Programming is like building with Lego blocks. You start with simple blocks and then combine them to create more complex structures.

This is a first post in what I hope will be a series of posts on programming. Also, I wrote some of these using Copilot which is also a phenomenal program.
