There is a lot our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ paid for on our 
behalf through His death and sufferings on the cross, and I 
earnestly believe the key to enjoying these benefits is an 
understanding of the Righteousness He has procured for us, and a 
firm foundation and relationship with God built on this 
Righteousness which comes by Faith.
<br></br>
For those who do not believe in the Lord Jesus, know that God is not 
counting your sins against you because of that one sacrifice of 
Christ (2Cor 5:19). I beseech you, be reconciled unto God.
<br></br>
**Righteousness by Faith** starts with God's mercy and grace found only in Christ. God 
designed it in such a way that He is not just being merciful in 
calling us righteous, He is also just in justifying us (Romans 
3:26). You should know today, that you are forever loved and 
accepted in Christ. But you may say, what of my sins and 
transgressions, what of my wrong doings? Beloved, your sins are 
washed in the blood of the lamb, our Lord Jesus, and you are also 
continually being washed in His blood so that you are ever without 
blemish before our righteous Abba, forever (1Jn 1:7). 
<br></br>
This book is written to teach readers to know what righteousness is, 
how it is attained, the benefits, and how to embrace a 
no-strings-attached authentic relationship with God. Through the 
redemption found in our Lord Jesus, God today righteously passes 
over your sins as He did for the Israelites in the land of Egypt 
when the destroyer passed over every house with the blood on 
it's lintel and side posts (Exodus 12:23). 
<br></br>
**Rom 3:26** To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might 
be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. 
<br></br>
**Rom 3:23** For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 
Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is 
in Christ Jesus: 
<br></br>
**Exo 12:23** For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he 
seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the 
LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to 
come in unto your houses to smite you. 
<br></br>
**2Co 5:19** that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not 
counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the 
message of reconciliation.
